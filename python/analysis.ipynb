    "[Source link](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mri-sequences-overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "### T2W\n",
    "\n",
    "T2 weighted sequences are part of almost all MRI protocols. Without modification the dominant signal intensities of different tissues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fluid (e.g. urine, CSF): high signal intensity (white)\n",
    "* muscle: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "* fat: high signal intensity (white)\n",
    "Brain\n",
    "* grey matter: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "* white matter: hypointense compared to grey matter (dark-ish)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast or turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) is an adaptation of conventional spin-echo (SE) acquisition technique designed to reduce imaging time. It has largely supplanted the original spin-echo technique due to vastly improved imaging speed.\n",
    "[Source link](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fast-spin-echo)\n",
    "\n",
    "ther limitations of FSE include overly bright signals from fat on T2-weighted images and overly bright CSF on spin-density-weighted images. \n",
    "[Source link](http://mriquestions.com/what-is-fsetse.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PD-W (proton density-weighted)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that nuclear magnetic resonance of protons (hydrogen ions) forms the major basis of MRI, it is not surprising that signal can be weighted to reflect the actual density of protons; an intermediate sequence sharing some features of both T1 and T2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proton density images were extensively used for brain imaging, however they have largely been replaced by FLAIR. PD however continues to offer excellent signal distinction between fluid, hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage, which makes this sequence ideal in the assessment of joints. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant signal intensities of different tissues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fluid (e.g. joint fluid, CSF): high signal intensity (white)\n",
    "* muscle: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "* fat: high signal intensity (white)\n",
    "* hyaline cartilage: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "* fibrocartilage: low signal intensity (black)\n",
    "\n",
    "### DCE (dynamic contrast enhanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR perfusion, sometimes also referred to as permeability MRI, is one of the main MRI perfusion techniques which calculates perfusion parameters by evaluating T1 shortening induced by a gadolinium-based contrast bolus passing through tissue. \n",
    "\n",
    "### K-trans\n",
    "\n",
    "K trans is a measure of capillary permeability obtained using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR perfusion. It is calculated by measuring the accumulation of gadolinium-based contrast agent in the extravascular-extracellular space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Increased permeability of vessels in the brain is seen in a variety of conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* glioma: VEGF produced by the tumour reduces the effectiveness of gap junction and creates fenestrations in the endothelium of brain capillaries; this has been shown to correlate with tumour grade 1\n",
    "* cerebral metastases, which lack blood brain barrier and resemble the vascularity of the parent tissue\n",
    "* inflammatory lesions (e.g. demyelinating plaques of multiple sclerosis)\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that how ktrans is interpreted varied according to permeability and blood flow. In situations where permeability is very low (near-intact blood brain barrier) then ktrans is a useful measure of permeability, whereas in situations where permeability is very high (disrupted blood brain barrier) then ktrans will reflect blood flow 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DW (diffusion-weighted imaging)\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion weighted imaging assess the ease with which water molecules move around within a tissue (mostly representing fluid within the extracellular space) and gives insight into cellularity (e.g. tumours), cell swelling (e.g. ischaemia) and oedema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant signal intensities of different tissues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "fluid (e.g. urine, CSF): no restriction to diffusion\n",
    "soft tissues (muscle, solid organs, brain): intermediate diffusion\n",
    "fat: little signal due to paucity of water\n",
    "Typically you will find three sets of images when diffusion weighted imaging is performed: DWI, ADC and B=0 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DWI\n",
    "When we say \"DWI\" we usually are referring to what is in better terms an isotropic T2 weighted map as it represents the combination of actual diffusion values and T2 signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a relatively low resolution image with the following appearance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* grey matter: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "* white matter: slightly hypointense compared to grey matter\n",
    "* CSF: low signal (black)\n",
    "* fat: little signal due to paucity of water\n",
    "* other soft tissues: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "Acute pathology (ischaemic stroke, cellular tumour, pus) usually appears as increased signal denoting restricted diffusion. However (and importantly), because there is a component of the image derived from T2 signal, some tissues that are bright on T2 will appear bright on DWI images without there being an abnormal restricted diffusion. This phenomenon is known as T2 shine through.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ADC\n",
    "Apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC) are images representing the actual diffusion values of the tissue without T2 effects. They are therefore much more useful, and objective measures of diffusion values can be obtained, however they are much less pretty to look at. They appear basically as grayscale inverted DWI images.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are relatively low resolution images with the following appearances:\n",
    "\n",
    "* grey matter: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "* white matter: slightly hyperintense compared to grey matter\n",
    "* CSF: high signal (white)\n",
    "* fat: little signal due to paucity of water\n",
    "* other soft tissues: intermediate signal intensity (grey)\n",
    "* Acute pathology (ischaemic stroke, cellular tumour, pus) usually appears as decreased signal denoting restricted diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B=0\n",
    "If you see these, do not worry. They are only used to calculate ADC values. They are essentially T2 weighted images with a bit of susceptibility effects.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **sagittal** or lateral plane dives the body into left and right halves and is an x-z plane. Technically, the sagittal or median plane goes right through the middle between the body’s left and right halves. Planes parallel the sagittal planes are called parasagittal planes. It is called the sagittal plane because it goes through or is parallel to the sagittal suture, the line running along the top of the skull that marks where the left and right halves of the skull grew together.\n",
